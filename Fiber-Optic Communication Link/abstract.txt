\section*{Abstract}
\textbf{Purpose:} The purpose of this project is to create a communication channel that transmits and receives data via Amplitude Shift Key (ASK) modulation of electromagnetic carrier waves \cite{Wavelength_Electronics_2022}. In particular, we will adjust a potentiometer to a resistance value of $R$ and this value will be transmitted via fiber optic cable and displayed on an LCD screen connected to the receiver part of the system. \\

\textbf{Approach:} We outline the schematic of our system as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create and upload a program to a $1^{\text{st}}$ arduino that will read the resistance value of the potentiometer and convert it to binary.
    \item The 0s and 1s will modulate the voltage supplied to a fiber optic transmitter module through an appropriate driver circuit so that the intensity and amplitude of the wave changes accordingly \cite{Majumdar}.
    \item The modulated wave will travel through a fiber optic cable to a fiber optic receiver module.
    \item The photodiode inside the receiver module will drive a current that is proportional to the intensity of the light signal, which will then be amplified and converted into a logic-level signal via a 2$^\text{nd}$ arduino \cite{Smith}.
    \item The arduino on the receiver side will interpret the contents of the signal into text characters which will finally be displayed on an LCD screen.
\end{enumerate}
